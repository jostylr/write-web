# Editor

I like prose.io, but it has a tab issue and it is not vim setup. I want my own browser editor. Fortunately, I have a server. 

The idea is to set up a separate user for each github user that you want on the machine. Set it up for push/pull access using the private key stuff. 

This file creates an editor backend which can be routed by nginx via do.jostylr.com/username  and sub heading for writing. A modal login can popup and save a cookie if desired (private local machine). The editor instance has a codemirror in vim mode with tab set to do spaces.

It should have automated saving to the server every minute in a distinct directory of some kind. When actually saved, it asks for change log and whether to commit. It saves it to disk and possibly pushes. Hopefully it all works out. 

Going to be sketchy initially.
