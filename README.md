write-web
=========

This is a repository setup for writing to the web.

It (will) contains a literate program that creates a plain starter template. 

The idea is that you create some pages in markdown, run litpro, and then you
have a website. 

In the server directory, I have a literate program that generates various
scripts that may be of use in automating some parts. It describes the ideal
setup.
