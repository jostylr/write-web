# Write-web

The idea of this project is to setup my own personal server that allows my repositories to become anything.

This is the master literate program that compiles all the different pieces for
getting writeweb.net up and running. 

The goal of writeweb.net is to introduce the world of light sites to the
masses in an easy and cheap way. Ideally, it should be almost as easy as
editing a few simple markdown documents of content and clicking on a link. 

* [scripts](scripts.md "load:")  This a series of scripts for setting up the server and running it. 
* [editor](editor.md "load:")  This allows for the editing of the respositories and upload files directly to it.
